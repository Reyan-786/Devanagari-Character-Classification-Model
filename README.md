# Devanagari-Character-Classification-Model
A Deep Learning Model that classifies the characters of the Devanagari Script belonging to 33 different classes.
I Built it in one of the Hackathons that i took part in...
it was a 5 hour long hackathon in which we were given this problem of classification and we had to make a ML/DL model to solve the problem....
On the unseen test data it performed with an accuracy of 88% ....

P.S-: I achieved the 3rd rank for this model and also recieved prize money of INR 5K...:;


**Note** - I'll update this repo with a better model hopefully soon.... ;)
